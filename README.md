This holds my personal site.

For security reasons certain files have been excluded.

This site is built using django and in its present state is divided into 2 apps, Chloe, and Finance.

Chloe:
This app contains the primary functionality of the site. The home page, nav bar, blog, project tab, and contact info.
This is all that most site visitors will see

Finance:
This app contains budgetting, tracking, and forecasting financial tools. It is still a work in progress.
It is protected via user login and is only accesible through the URL or by navigating to it from the project tab of the main site.
